Hello, I've decided to release this gamemode. It's a basic roleplay created from scratch. Please remember that this gamemode was developed back in 2016, so there's no need to comment that it's not based on MySQL, and similar aspects. Before judging this script, please test it. Be aware that there might be a few bugs. If you find any, please comment in the section below, and I will fix them as soon as possible.
